# Examples of filters

## `atTop` filter on a totally ordered set

Let `L` be a non-empty totally ordered set. Let's say that a subset `X` of `L` is
"big" if there exists `x : L` such for all `y ≥ x`, `y ∈ X`.

I claim that the big subsets are a filter. Check this. The mathematical idea
is that the "big subsets" are the neighbourhoods of `∞`, so the corresponding
filter is some representation of an infinitesimal neighbourhood of `∞`.

Implementation notes: `LinearOrder L` is the type of linear orders on `L`.
`e : L` is just an easy way of saying that `L` is nonempty.

Recall that `max x y` is the max of x and y in a `LinearOrder`, and
`le_max_left a b : a ≤ max a b` and similarly `le_max_right`.

-- (The real definition of the atTop filter is more general than this: it only assumes that we have
-- a preorder. But for now, where we're just thinking about going to infinity in ℕ or ℝ, a nonempty

## the cofinite filter

The _cofinite filter_ on a type `α` has as its sets the subsets `S : set α`
with the property that `Sᶜ`, the complement of `S`, is finite.
Let's show that these are a filter.

Things you might find helpful:

`compl_univ : univᶜ = ∅`
`finite_empty : Finite ∅`
`compl_subset_compl : Xᶜ ⊆ Yᶜ ↔ Y ⊆ X`
`Finite.subset : S.finite → ∀ {T : set α}, T ⊆ S → T.Finite`
`compl_inter S T : (S ∩ T)ᶜ = Sᶜ ∪ Tᶜ`
`Finite.union : S.finite → T.finite → (S ∪ T).Finite`

NB if you are thinking "I could never use Lean by myself, I don't know
the names of all the lemmas so I have to rely on someone telling them all to
me" then what you don't realise is that I myself don't know the names
of all the lemmas either -- I am literally just guessing them and pressing
ctrl-space to check. Look at the names of the lemmas and begin to understand
that you can probably guess them yourself.

## Harder exercises.

If you like this filter stuff, then formalise in Lean and prove the following:

(1) prove that the cofinite filter on a finite type is the entire power set filter (`⊥`).
(2) prove that the cofinite filter on `ℕ` is equal to the `atTop` filter.
(3) Prove that the cofinite filter on `ℤ` is not equal to the `atTop` filter.
(4) Prove that the cofinite filter on `ℕ` is not principal.
